        <p>some of the happiest times of my life. finally earning enough to pay for my own rent and my own travels, hanging out with my friends for a month on the other side of the world, what more can i ask for? well, maybe not getting sick right when we arrived in japan thanks to our red-eye flight, but oh well: classic college moves <span style="font-size:0.85em">¯\_(ツ)_/¯</span></p>
        <p>originally, i also had some mediocre phone photos hidden behind these ones as multi-photo posts on instagram, but i haven't figured out how to best display them here yet. stay tuned i guess?</p>
