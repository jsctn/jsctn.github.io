        <p>looking back now, these photos of my friends taken in late 2018 are some of my favorites. i don't know if i could ever replicate the energy in these: there's something special about entering senior year of college, finally feeling like i have a sense of the person i want to be, a little apprehensive about graduation still months away but mostly excited to take on the world. in the few years since, i feel so defeated by the loneliness of work life and the sheer horror of the pandemic. looking back now, i'd like to find that optimism and energy again.</p>
